#define tempHipoSelector_cxx
// The class definition in tempHipoSelector.h has been generated automatically
// by the ROOT utility TTree::MakeSelector(). This class is derived
// from the ROOT class TSelector. For more information on the TSelector
// framework see $ROOTSYS/README/README.SELECTOR or the ROOT User Manual.


// The following methods are defined in this file:
//    Begin():        called every time a loop on the tree starts,
//                    a convenient place to create your histograms.
//    SlaveBegin():   called after Begin(), when on PROOF called only on the
//                    slave servers.
//    Process():      called for each event, in this function you decide what
//                    to read and fill your histograms.
//    SlaveTerminate: called at the end of the loop on the tree, when on PROOF
//                    called only on the slave servers.
//    Terminate():    called at the end of the loop on the tree,
//                    a convenient place to draw/fit your histograms.
